## README

 RAWmakase

RAWmakase is a fast, non-destructive RAW photo developer for Linux, macOS and Windows, written in Rust. It opens RAW files from any camera LibRaw supports, develops them with a Lightroom-style set of controls, and exports JPEG or 16-bit TIFF. It can also import a Lightroom Classic catalog with its ratings, flags, labels, keywords and compatible develop settings, without ever writing to the original catalog or your photos.

RAWmakase Develop view with presets, the photo, and curve and color controls

 ⬇ Download the latest version
 macOS (Apple Silicon, Intel) · Linux (.deb, .rpm, Arch) · Windows (x86_64) · install notes

It is a personal project in active development. Rendering aims for close, not exact, Lightroom parity; see parity gaps.

## Features

- **Develop**: white balance and picker, one-click Auto tone and Auto white balance, exposure and tone, Shadows/Highlights, Clarity, Dehaze, point curves and levels, HSL color mixer, three-way color grading, detail (denoise and sharpening), crop, straighten and Transform, lens corrections, effects and calibration.
- **Spot removal and masks (experimental, early)**: Heal and Clone spots and brushed areas with automatic sources, and brush, gradient and range masks with local adjustments, also imported from Lightroom. Not yet measured against Lightroom.
- **Library**: SQLite catalogs, folders and collections, ratings, flags, color labels, keywords, filtering, and non-destructive Lightroom `.lrcat` import with folder relinking.
- **Presets and profiles**: Lightroom XMP presets, plus DCP and XMP camera profiles you import yourself.
- **Non-destructive**: originals are never modified. Edits live in the catalog, and all writes are atomic.
- **Fast previews**: a quick draft first, then full quality, with GPU finishing (Metal on macOS, Vulkan on Linux) and CPU fallback.
- **Command line**: inspect, render, export thumbnails, import catalogs and benchmark without the GUI.

## Coming soon

- LUT support
- AI-powered masks and object removal
- Built-in open source preset library
- Agentic features: e.g. culling assistance

## Install

Download the package for your system from GitHub Releases. Older releases may have only the original Arch-built Linux archive; use the requirements in that release's notes.

### Let your agent install it

Point your coding agent to GitHub Releases and tell it to install the latest version for your operating system, or give it this prompt:

```text
Install the latest release of RAWmakase for my operating system from https://github.com/pch/rawmakase/releases. Pick the right package for my OS and CPU architecture, verify it against the release's checksums, install it, and tell me how to launch it.
```

### macOS (15 or newer)

Install with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install --cask pch/tap/rawmakase
```

Update with `brew upgrade --cask rawmakase`.

Or install the DMG directly:

Choose `rawmakase-v -macos-arm64.dmg` for Apple Silicon or `rawmakase-v -macos-x86_64.dmg` for Intel. Open the DMG, drag **RAWmakase** into **Applications**, and launch it there. Release DMGs are signed and notarized, and include their imaging libraries; Homebrew is not required.

### Linux (x86_64 and aarch64)

Download the package for your architecture (`amd64`/`x86_64` or `arm64`/`aarch64`), then run the matching command from its folder, replacing the filename with the one you downloaded:

| System | Package | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian 13+ | `.deb` | `sudo apt install ./rawmakase_ _amd64.deb` |
| Fedora 43+ | `.rpm` | `sudo dnf install ./rawmakase- -1.x86_64.rpm` |
| Arch Linux (x86_64) | `.pkg.tar.zst` | `sudo pacman -U ./rawmakase- -1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst` |

DEB/RPM packages include LibRaw and Little CMS. Arch packages use system dependencies. A working graphics driver is required; install your desktop's `xdg-desktop-portal` backend for native file dialogs.

**AUR publication is paused.** Install the Arch package directly, or (on Arch Linux ARM too) download and extract `rawmakase- -arch-recipe.tar.gz` into an empty folder and build as a normal user:

```sh
makepkg -si
```

The development recipe is in packaging/arch/rawmakase-git.

The `rawmakase- - -linux.tar.gz` download contains the same bundled imaging libraries as the DEB/RPM packages. Extract it and run `./usr/bin/rawmakase` from the extracted folder. Keep the whole directory together. It requires the same OS/runtime baseline as the packages above; it is not a fully static build.

### Windows (10 or newer, x86_64)

Run `rawmakase-v -x86_64-pc-windows-msvc-setup.exe`. It installs for your user account only, without administrator rights, and adds RAWmakase to the Start menu. The installer is not code-signed yet, so Microsoft Defender SmartScreen may warn about an unrecognized app: choose **More info → Run anyway**. For a copy without installing, extract `rawmakase-v -x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` and run `rawmakase.exe` from the extracted folder.

### Updates and verification

To update, download a newer release and repeat the installation steps (replace the app in Applications on macOS). Settings and catalogs are kept separately from the installed application. There is currently no in-app updater or automatic package repository.

Each new packaged release includes `SHA256SUMS`. After downloading it beside your package, verify downloaded files on Linux with `sha256sum --ignore-missing -c SHA256SUMS`. On macOS, use `shasum -a 256 ` and compare the result with that file's entry in `SHA256SUMS`.

### From source (Linux and macOS)

You need Rust 1.98 or newer, a C++17 compiler with OpenMP, pkg-config, LibRaw 0.22 or newer, and Little CMS 2.

- Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S rust base-devel pkgconf libraw lcms2`
- macOS: `brew install pkg-config libraw little-cms2 libomp`. Use a native rustup toolchain (`aarch64-apple-darwin` on Apple Silicon); `LIBOMP_PREFIX` points the build at a non-Homebrew OpenMP.

```sh
make                                  # cargo build --release --locked
make install PREFIX="$HOME/.local"    # binary, desktop entry, icon and licenses
```

`make install` never builds, so `make && sudo make install PREFIX=/usr` does not compile as root. `make uninstall` removes the installed files.

On macOS, `packaging/macos/app.sh` builds `target/release/RAWmakase.app`, which you can open from Finder. It uses the Homebrew libraries installed on your Mac and is not a signed, self-contained distribution.

## Usage

```sh
rawmakase                     # reopen the last catalog
rawmakase Photos.rawmakase    # open a catalog
rawmakase photo.dng           # add the photo's folder to the last catalog and edit it
```

Photos are edited through the Library. A photo dropped onto the window or passed on the command line has its folder added to the open catalog, then opens in Develop; edits it got in earlier releases (its `photo.rawmakase.json`) come along. You can also drop a catalog onto the window. The first launch offers to create a catalog or import a Lightroom catalog; both are available later from the **Catalog** menu. The camera's embedded JPEG shows immediately while the RAW develops.

Useful shortcuts:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Left / Right | Previous / next photo |
| F / Z | Fit / toggle Fit and 100% |
| 0–5, 6–9 | Rating; red, yellow, green, blue label |
| P / X / U | Pick / reject / clear flag |
| Shift + rating, label or flag key | Apply and advance |
| R or C | Crop |
| J | Clipping indicators |
| Backslash | Before / after |
| Cmd/Ctrl+Z, Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z | Undo / redo |
| Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+U | Auto tone |

Double-click a slider to reset it, or type its value for precision.

### Camera profiles

RAWmakase does not ship any camera profiles. Without one, it renders with the camera matrix LibRaw provides. For Lightroom-like color, import DCP and XMP profiles you are licensed to use (for example from your own Lightroom or Camera Raw installation, or published third-party DCPs such as RawTherapee's) with **Edit → Import profiles…** or `rawmakase import-profiles`. They are copied into RAWmakase's own data directory. See Lightroom profiles.

### Command line

```sh
rawmakase inspect photo.dng
rawmakase thumbnail photo.dng embedded.jpg
rawmakase render photo.dng edited.jpg --exposure 0.7 --max-edge 2400
rawmakase render photo.dng edited.tiff --xmp preset.xmp
rawmakase render photo.dng edited.jpg --auto
rawmakase import-catalog Lightroom.lrcat Photos.rawmakase
rawmakase help
```

`render` applies the photo's saved edits unless `--recipe` or `--xmp` supplies settings, and it needs `--overwrite` to replace an existing file.

### Where data lives

- Catalogs, with every edit: the `.rawmakase` file you choose.
- Edits saved beside photos by releases before 0.1.8 (`photo.dng.rawmakase.json`, with spots and masks in `photo.dng.rawmakase-local.json`, or in the data directory's `sidecars/` folder for read-only locations) are brought into the catalog when you add their folder, and left as they are.
- Profiles, presets, previews and session state: `~/Library/Application Support/RAWmakase` on macOS, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/rawmakase` (default `~/.local/share/rawmakase`) on Linux, `%APPDATA%\RAWmakase` on Windows. `RAWMAKASE_DATA_DIR` overrides it.

Exports are always sRGB. The display defaults to sRGB; pick a monitor ICC profile under **More** only if your compositor does not already manage color.

## Development

Start with the code map and the architecture guide.

```sh
make check    # cargo fmt --check, clippy -D warnings, cargo test
```

The repository contains no RAW photos, Lightroom catalogs or camera profiles, so tests that need them are ignored by default. Run them with your own files:

| Environment variable | Test target | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RAWMAKASE_FIXTURES` | `--test raw_fixtures` | A folder of RAW files (the test currently expects both a Bayer and an X-Trans file) |
| `RAWMAKASE_PROFILES` | `--test private_profiles` | A folder of DCP files |
| `RAWMAKASE_TEST_DCP` | `--lib camera_profiles` | A DCP file (the assertions currently match RawTherapee's `SONY ILCE-7M2.dcp`) |
| `RAWMAKASE_LRCAT` | `--lib catalog` | A Lightroom catalog |

```sh
RAWMAKASE_FIXTURES=~/raw-fixtures cargo test --release --test raw_fixtures -- --ignored --nocapture
```

GPU tests are ignored as well; run them with `cargo test --lib gpu -- --ignored` on a machine with a compute adapter.

CI runs `make check`, a release build, an Arch package build and a `cargo deny` license and advisory audit on every push and pull request. A stable `vX.Y.Z` tag on `main` matching `Cargo.toml` builds both macOS DMGs, the Linux packages and the Windows installer. Publication waits for Apple notarization and package checks. See packaging/RELEASING.md for credentials, rehearsal runs, supported systems and the AUR pause.
