# aido 🥋

**AI does, you decide.**

Hand Claude Code the whole feature: the spec, the tests, the code, the commits and the pull request.
aido stops at every decision that matters and asks you, so what gets built stays your call. It works
with any stack.

```
/plugin marketplace add joebew42/aido
/plugin install aido@aido
/aido:1-plan
```

Every skill is available as `/aido: `.

At every stage the agent proposes and you decide: approving the draft, spec and plan; deciding on misalignments with your repository; picking what to implement; approving the commit grouping and every push; verifying and approving the PR; picking which review feedback to address

/aido:1-plan waiting for an answer: it asks whether to start from a GitHub issue, a SPEC.md.draft you write yourself, or a conversation

## Your first feature

| Step | Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `/aido:1-plan` | Specifies and plans the feature in `SPEC.md` |
| 2 | `/aido:2-implement` | Builds the feature |
| 3 | `/aido:3-organize-commits` | Cleans up the commit history |
| 4 | `/aido:4-create-pr` | Creates the pull request |
| 5 | `/aido:5-handle-review` | Handles the review feedback |

`/aido:1-plan` drafts the specification in `SPEC.md.draft` (from a GitHub issue, one you write, or a
conversation with you), checks it against your repository and refines it with you until you approve
it as `SPEC.md`, plans the work, creates the branch, and offers to move on to implementation. When
the change looks small and clear, it proposes a lighter route: a brief specification and plan that
you approve once, without the enabling refactoring analysis. `/aido:3-organize-commits` asks whether
to revert `SPEC.md` (the default) or keep it in the repository's docs. `/aido:4-create-pr` offers to
verify the implementation against the specification before pushing and, once the PR exists, to open
issues for the deferred points you pick, so they outlive the specification.

## Recommended user settings

The guidelines ask for commits and PRs without AI attribution and for no auto-memory. A plugin
can't set these, so add them to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "autoMemoryEnabled": false,
  "attribution": { "commit": "", "pr": "" }
}
```

The plugin's hooks also block commit messages with `Co-Authored-By` trailers and writes to Claude's
memory directory.

## Why aido: AI-Augmented Engineering

An AI-augmented engineer uses an AI agent to do more of the work, without handing over the
judgement. The agent explores the code, drafts the specification, writes the tests and the code,
and shapes the commits and the pull request. The engineer decides what gets built, approves every
step that matters, and stays accountable for the result.

`aido` stands for "AI do" and echoes `sudo`: the agent does the work, on your say-so. It is a
workflow for working that way, and each of its practices keeps that split in place:

- **The engineer decides, the agent proposes.** Each stage ends with an explicit approval — the
 specification, the plan, the commit structure, the pull request — and the agent asks instead of
 guessing whenever a choice is yours.
- **Specification before code.** Every feature starts as a draft that is refined with you into
 `SPEC.md`, then planned. A small, clear change can take a lighter route, with the specification
 and the plan approved together. Implementation only starts from an approved plan.
- **Small, reviewable steps.** Code grows test by test with test-driven development, so each change
 is easy to follow and to stop.
- **Good engineering practices by default.** Clean architecture, deliberate refactoring, focused
 tests and a clean commit history are part of every step, not an afterthought.
- **Your repository's rules come first.** aido brings practices, not conventions. How to
 test, lint, name or structure code comes from your repository — first from its `CLAUDE.md` and
 `AGENTS.md`, then from the code itself.

## How the workflow works

### The specification is at the center

Every stage works from one file, `SPEC.md`. Planning writes the specification, the plan and the
design notes into it. Implementation reads the plan and records its progress there. The pull
request description is written from it, and review feedback is checked against it. `/aido:verify`
checks the code against it.

SPEC.md at the center: planning writes it, implementation reads and updates it, organizing commits reverts it or moves it into the docs, the PR is written from it, review reads it without changing it, and verification checks the code against it

Every specification has the same shape. **Context** says why the change is needed, **Intent** what
it must achieve, **Out of scope** what it leaves out, and **Acceptance criteria** — numbered `AC1`,
`AC2`, … — how you will know it is done. The specification says what and why; how belongs to the
plan that planning adds below it, followed by the progress that implementation records.

### Acceptance criteria are checked at every stage

The acceptance criteria are what verifies that the change does what the specification asks, not
just what the plan lists:

- **planning** proposes them when the draft has none, and every plan item names the criteria it
 serves — none is left without one
- **implementation** writes each criterion's acceptance test first and keeps it red as the goal
 post while the code behind it is built test-driven. Before it calls the feature done, it checks
 every criterion: a test that covers it, or — for criteria only a person can judge, marked
 `(manual)` — your confirmation. When one is not met, you choose to implement it, change it, or
 defer it
- **verification** checks them again from a fresh context, and any deferred criterion is named in
 the pull request description, and offered as a GitHub issue once the pull request exists

### The specification is checked against your repository

A specification can be clear and still conflict with the repository it is meant for. `/aido:1-plan`
checks for that before you approve it, and `/aido:2-implement` checks again at the start of every
session, in case the default branch has moved. When nothing relevant changed, that costs one line.

A misalignment is significant when the specification contradicts your `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`,
crosses an architectural boundary, or changes behaviour other code relies on. The agent then explains
the conflict, cites the files that show it, and recommends revising or rejecting the specification.
You can still proceed, since intentional architectural changes are sometimes the point, and the
decision and your reason are recorded in the specification.

### Verifying that you built what you agreed

`/aido:verify` asks one question of the current branch or any PR: does the implementation satisfy
what was agreed? `/aido:4-create-pr` offers to run it before pushing, and you can run it at any time.
It always runs from a fresh context, so the agent that built the change is not the one judging it,
and it changes nothing.

Its report sorts every requirement as **verified**, **insufficient evidence** or **unmet**, and lists
**deviations** from what was agreed separately. A requirement is verified only by a test that passed
during the verification, or by your recorded confirmation; claims in the specification's progress
notes do not count. On a PR with no specification, it uses the description and linked issues, and
says that this is weaker.

It complements Claude Code's `/code-review` rather than replacing it. `/aido:verify` asks whether you
built what you agreed to build, and `/code-review` asks whether the code has defects.

### You stay in the loop

The agent does the work, but it stops before every decision that matters: it does not approve the
specification, choose a refactoring that reaches into another module, rewrite history or push
without you. The only way past these checkpoints is to deliberately run the workflow fully
unsupervised. The diagram at the top of this page shows where it stops at each stage.

For example, when you run `/aido:1-plan`, it stops to ask where the specification comes from: a
GitHub issue it turns into a draft, a draft you write yourself, or a conversation in which it
interviews you and writes the draft. The screenshot at the top of this page shows that question.

## Skills

### Single-phase feature

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/aido:1-plan` | draft, refine and plan a feature into `SPEC.md` |
| `/aido:2-implement` | implement the feature with TDD |
| `/aido:3-organize-commits` | organize the commit history |
| `/aido:4-create-pr` | create a pull request |
| `/aido:5-handle-review` | handle PR review feedback |

### Multi-phase feature

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/aido:multi-phase-spec-pr` | create the specification tracking PR |
| `/aido:multi-phase-switch` | switch to the main plan branch |
| `/aido:multi-phase-sync` | sync the main plan with progress |

### Utilities

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/aido:resolve-migration-conflict` | resolve database migration conflicts after a rebase, with any migration tool |
| `/aido:verify` | check the current branch or a PR against what was agreed, from a fresh context |
| `/aido:stabilize` | take over a PR, remote branch, or local changes made outside this workflow |
| `/aido:map-architecture` | build or update a slim index of the repo's domain areas and their building blocks |
| `/aido:assess-architecture` | assess the architecture area by area and open GitHub issues for the refactorings you pick |

## Other ways to use it

### A multi-phase feature

1. Write the overall feature specification in `SPEC.md.draft`
2. `/aido:multi-phase-spec-pr` — creates the main tracking PR
3. For each phase (or set of parallel phases):
 - `/aido:1-plan` — plans the phase, and offers parallel worktrees for independent phases
 - `/aido:2-implement`, `/aido:3-organize-commits`, `/aido:4-create-pr`
 - `/aido:multi-phase-sync` — updates the main plan and starts the next phase

### Taking over someone else's work

1. `/aido:stabilize`, pointed at the PR, remote branch, or local changes
2. Choose whether to reimplement from scratch or carry the original changes over and adjust them
3. Approve the plan it writes into `SPEC.md`
4. Continue with `/aido:2-implement`, `/aido:3-organize-commits` and `/aido:4-create-pr`

### Reviewing someone else's PR

Run `/aido:verify ` to check it against what was agreed, and `/code-review` to look for
defects.

### A migration conflict after a rebase

Run `/aido:resolve-migration-conflict` when another PR's migration was merged while yours was open.
