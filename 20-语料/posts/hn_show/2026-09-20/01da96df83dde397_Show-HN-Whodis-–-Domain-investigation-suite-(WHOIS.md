 WHODIS: Web Host Observatory Domain Investigation Suite

 A full, evidence-backed domain investigation suite.
 Find out who operates a domain and what is behind it: registration, DNS,
 infrastructure, diagnostics, web technology, related domains, and changes over time.

 Quick start ·
 Issues

 One engine. Use it your way.

 Terminal
 Native desktop

 Fast in shells, scripts, SSH sessions, and servers.
 Native controls on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

`whodis cyberbrand.net` discovers the authoritative source automatically and
turns the result into a readable terminal workspace. The separately packaged
desktop application presents the same normalized investigation engine through
focused native views. Start with the original question; go deeper when you
need the whole story.

## One target. The answer you need

Whodis accepts a domain, IP address, network, or ASN. Registration identity is
the effortless default; focused operations add DNS, service health,
infrastructure attribution, technology evidence, research pivots, and change
tracking without making the simple lookup complicated.

| Question | Command | What Whodis shows |
|---|---|---|
| Who manages it? | `whodis cyberbrand.net` | Authoritative RDAP, WHOIS, or RWhois registration, status, dates, contacts, and nameservers |
| What is published? | `whodis inspect cyberbrand.net` | Registration plus a practical public-DNS inventory |
| Is it configured and reachable? | `whodis diagnose cyberbrand.net` | DNS, delegation, web, TLS, mail, and advertised-service findings |
| What is behind the site? | `whodis investigate cyberbrand.net` | Hosting and network attribution, technology stack, homepage observations, research links, and evidence |
| What changed or needs attention? | `whodis diff …` / `whodis check …` | Semantic changes and deterministic policy results for automation or monitoring |

## A full domain investigation suite

- **Registration and identity:** Route domains, IPs, networks, and ASNs to
 the right IANA-published RDAP authority, fall back to WHOIS when appropriate,
 and follow RWhois referrals without making users learn the protocol map.
- **DNS and delegation:** Inventory records, query arbitrary types, compare
 resolvers, validate DNSSEC, trace delegation from the root, and perform
 explicit bounded zone transfers.
- **Infrastructure and service diagnostics:** Connect public DNS to network
 ownership, hosting signals, HTTP, TLS, SMTP, mail policy, reachability, and
 advertised services with scoped findings instead of an opaque score.
- **Website technology investigation:** Identify platforms, versions,
 WordPress plugins and themes, commerce, optimization, server and edge
 technology, and homepage delivery signals with confidence and inspectable
 evidence.
- **Research and relationships:** Generate curated manual pivots for public
 sources and, only when requested, add bounded AlienVault OTX passive-DNS
 observations without presenting historical neighbors as ownership claims.
- **Change tracking and automation:** Save sanitized observations, compare
 meaningful changes, enforce policy, process large batches, and export a
 stable report for scripts and other applications.

## Built for terminals, desktops, and automation

- **Responsive terminal dashboard:** A spreadsheet-like panel grid uses
 the available width without repeating contacts, notices, or nameservers.
- **Multiple layouts:** Dashboard, semantic tree, retro GeekBoys ASCII,
 and portable plain text are one switch away.
- **Structured output:** Versioned JSON/YAML, one-row-per-target CSV, and
 streaming-friendly NDJSON support automation; Markdown makes a portable
 report.
- **Focused batch tables:** Check many targets, select fields such as
 expiration and registrar, and write directly to a file.
- **Raw source access:** Preserve the original RDAP JSON, WHOIS, or RWhois
 response when one unmodified registration lookup is what you need.
- **Native desktop workbench:** Lookup, DNS Inventory, DNS Query, Compare,
 Delegation, Diagnose, Stack, Research, Related, Services, Findings, Contacts, and Raw
 views without a browser or a separately installed CLI. Result columns are
 adjustable and remembered per view, while long values wrap instead of being
 clipped or forcing the whole layout sideways.
- **Help where you work:** Concise guides ship inside both applications. Use
 `whodis help [topic]` in a terminal or press **F1** in the desktop app; neither
 requires a browser or network connection.
- **Evidence-backed site profile:** Identify platforms, versions, WordPress
 plugins and themes, commerce, optimization, hosting, DNS, and mail, then
 review a score-free homepage delivery, SEO, security-header, and
 accessibility snapshot.

## Native desktop when you want it

The CLI stays small for shells, scripts, SSH sessions, and servers. The
separately packaged native desktop application exposes the same engine through
focused registration, DNS, diagnosis, investigation, research, findings,
batch, and raw-data views. The registration view appears beside the terminal
at the top of this page; the examples below show deeper desktop workflows.

The GUI and every terminal renderer consume the same normalized report. Long
registry notices are deduplicated and summarized; `--details` expands them.

## Install

Whodis releases two independent applications from one codebase:

- `whodis` is the small CLI for shells, scripts, SSH sessions, and servers.
- `whodis-gui` is the native desktop app. It bundles a private Whodis engine
 and does not require the CLI on `PATH`.

### Linux and macOS CLI

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Alex9001/whodis/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

The installer detects the operating system and CPU, verifies SHA-256 against
the release checksums, and installs `whodis` into `/usr/local/bin`. It asks for
`sudo` only when the destination is not writable.

### Windows CLI

Run this in PowerShell; an administrator window is not required:

```powershell
irm https://github.com/Alex9001/whodis/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer verifies the archive, installs under local application data, and
adds the directory to the user `PATH`. Open a new terminal and type `whodis`.

### Go, archives, and Arch Linux

```bash
go install github.com/Alex9001/whodis/v2/cmd/whodis@latest
```

Prebuilt CLI archives are published for Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, and
OpenBSD on amd64 and supported arm64 targets. Source-built AUR definitions for
`whodis` and `whodis-gui` are ready; the maintainer's one-time account and key
steps are in the AUR publication guide.

Each release also carries installable `.deb`, `.rpm`, Alpine Linux `.apk`, and
Arch Linux packages. An optional non-root multi-architecture container is
published to GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/alex9001/whodis example.com
```

Checksum-pinned Homebrew, Scoop, and Nix manifest generation is ready for
package-channel publication; see the
community package guide.
The README does not claim a channel is live until its upstream page exists.

### Desktop app

Download `whodis-gui` from the
latest GitHub Release:

- **Linux:** run the amd64 or arm64 AppImage.
- **Windows:** use the per-user setup executable or portable ZIP.
- **macOS:** open the universal DMG and drag Whodis into Applications.

Desktop packages are not code-signed or notarized. Windows SmartScreen and
macOS Gatekeeper will warn on first launch. Verify the published SHA-256
checksum or GitHub build attestation, then use **More info → Run anyway** on
Windows or **Open Anyway** in macOS Privacy & Security settings.

## Quick start

Registration stays effortless:

```bash
whodis google.com
whodis 8.8.8.8
whodis AS15169
```

Ask for the operation you want when you need more:

```bash
# Registration plus a practical public-DNS inventory, including MX
whodis inspect example.com

# DNS inventory without registration data
whodis dns inventory example.com

# Arbitrary DNS types or numeric TYPE values
whodis dns query example.com A AAAA MX HTTPS TYPE257

# Compare normalized answers from recursive and authoritative resolvers
whodis dns compare example.com A

# Follow delegation iteratively from a root server
whodis dns trace example.com NS

# Bounded DNS, reachability, HTTP, TLS, SMTP, and mail-policy checks
whodis diagnose example.com

# Explainable technology, provider, and network attribution from public evidence
whodis investigate example.com

# Explicitly add OTX passive-DNS history and live-check returned hostnames
WHODIS_OTX_API_KEY=... whodis investigate example.com --enrich otx

# Save a passive observation, compare it later, and enforce health policy
whodis inspect example.com --save --label production
whodis diff production --live
whodis check example.com --scrutiny strict
```

## Help is built in

Run `whodis help` to see command reference and the bundled guide catalog, then
open a focused topic such as `whodis help registration`, `whodis help dns`,
`whodis help investigate`, `whodis help snapshots`, or `whodis help
troubleshooting`. The native app exposes the same searchable guides through
**Help → Whodis Help** or **F1**, alongside links to the homepage, full online
documentation, and issue tracker.

The bundled material is intentionally concise and task-oriented. This README
remains the complete installation, architecture, safety, and limitation
reference, so command help does not become a stale second manual.

## A full DNS client, not a decorative lookup

`whodis dns query` accepts named or numeric record types and classes. Resolver
URIs select the transport explicitly:

| Resolver form | Transport |
|---|---|
| `system`, `1.1.1.1`, `udp://1.1.1.1` | UDP with automatic TCP retry on truncation |
| `tcp://1.1.1.1` | DNS over TCP |
| `tls://dns.example` or `dot://…` | DNS over TLS |
| `https://…/dns-query` | DNS over HTTPS |
| `h3://…/dns-query` | DNS over HTTP/3 |
| `doq://dns.example` | DNS over QUIC |
| `sdns://…` | DNSCrypt stamp |

Responses retain header flags, timing, transport, resolver identity, answer,
authority, additional records, raw wire bytes, EDNS Extended DNS Errors, and a
DNSSEC state. EDNS controls include buffer size, DO, NSID, explicit ECS,
cookie, padding, checking-disabled, and recursion behavior.

```bash
whodis dns query example.com MX TXT --resolver tls://dns.quad9.net --dnssec

whodis dns compare example.com A \
  --resolver https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query \
  --resolver tls://dns.google \
  --strategy consensus

whodis dns transfer example.com --ixfr --serial 12345 --tls
```

Compare ignores TTL and answer order when deciding whether resolvers disagree.
Trace follows referrals from embedded root hints and reports glue, missing glue,
lame delegation, and DNSSEC delegation state. AXFR and IXFR are always explicit,
bounded by a record safety limit, and support TSIG and TLS.

With `--dnssec`, Whodis locally verifies positive signed answer RRsets and their
DNSKEY/DS chain against embedded IANA root trust anchors. It reports `secure`,
`insecure`, `bogus`, or `indeterminate` rather than blindly trusting a
resolver's AD bit.

### Optional worldwide DNS views

Globalping is strictly opt-in because it sends the target and location request
to a third-party service and may consume API quota:

```bash
whodis dns query example.com A --globalping --from US --from Europe --limit 3
whodis diagnose example.com --remote
```

Set `GLOBALPING_TOKEN` when using authenticated quota. Whodis has no telemetry,
account system, or background network activity of its own.

## Diagnose without becoming a port scanner

`whodis diagnose` uses only endpoints derived from the target and its published
configuration. Work is time-bounded and capped:

- DNS inventory with local DNSSEC validation and iterative delegation tracing
- representative IPv4 and IPv6 reachability
- apex and `www` HTTP/HTTPS status and redirect chains
- TLS identity, certificate dates, cipher, version, and ALPN
- sampled MX SMTP greeting, EHLO capabilities, STARTTLS, and TLS verification
- SPF, DMARC, MTA-STS, and TLS-RPT discovery, plus MTA-STS policy retrieval
- DNS-advertised SRV, SVCB, and HTTPS service endpoints
- optional local path trace with `--trace`

Findings are deterministic `pass`, `info`, `warning`, or `error` observations
with evidence. There is deliberately no opaque overall score and no arbitrary
port-range scanner.

## Investigate a site's stack without hand-waving

`whodis investigate` builds on Diagnose and turns bounded public observations
into a quick, renderer-independent stack profile. It combines one homepage
HTTP response, DNS provider patterns, mail records, PTR names, and IP RDAP
registration. Web fingerprints use the MIT-licensed `wappalyzergo` engine,
augmented with conservative header, cookie-name, generator, asset-path, and
markup signals.

```bash
whodis investigate example.com
whodis investigate example.com --markdown -o profile.md
whodis investigate example.com --research-links all
whodis investigate example.com --enrich otx --related-limit 50 --json
```

Each detected component has a category, role, optional version and parent,
descriptive traits, `high`/`medium`/`low` confidence, the basis for that
confidence, and bounded evidence behind it. Known WordPress paths identify
products such as WooCommerce, Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms, ACF, Elementor,
Genesis, and common cache/optimization plugins. Unknown public plugin or theme
slugs are preserved as explicitly unmapped observations instead of being
silently discarded. Whodis deliberately
separates a network owner such as Amazon from a managed hosting provider, and
does not call a lone `autodiscover` record Microsoft 365 or cPanel. A compact
summary is followed by evidence tables in terminal output. In the desktop app,
the **Overview** immediately summarizes the web platform, commerce,
plugins/forms, theme, optimization, server/edge, hosting, network, DNS, mail,
and homepage observations. Homepage observations cover response delivery and
source-level asset hints, basic metadata, browser security headers, and a few
static accessibility markers. Their deterministic pass/info/warning entries
appear in the existing **Findings** view; there is no synthetic score. The
**Stack** view uses a clean master/detail layout: select one technology,
network, or note to see its wrapped summary and evidence below, without
repetitive evidence rows.
The dedicated **Research** view keeps manual third-party pivots out of the
evidence tree, grouped under the domain and each public IP. The **Related**
view keeps passive observations separate from stack claims.

Local investigation is the default. It reads at most the first 1 MiB of the
single final homepage response. It does not execute JavaScript, fetch
referenced assets, crawl additional pages, calculate Lighthouse/Core Web
Vitals, assign a site grade, scan arbitrary ports, or contact related domains.
A missing signal means only “not observed in this bounded response.” It is not
proof that a product is absent or that a security issue exists. Whodis locally
creates a curated set of links for AlienVault OTX, VirusTotal, BuiltWith, urlscan.io,
crt.sh, the Wayback Machine, Shodan, and Censys. It does not contact those
services until you explicitly open a link. Additional Wappalyzer, Netcraft,
GreyNoise, AbuseIPDB, BGP.Tools, and IPinfo links are available with
`--research-links all`; use `off` or a comma-separated provider list for an
exact selection. Some services may require their own account or impose their
own usage limits.

Research links are separate from enrichment. OTX
passive-DNS enrichment happens only with `--enrich otx`; discovered public web
IPs are sent to that service, returned observations are capped, and their
hostnames are checked against current A/AAAA DNS. `current`, `stale`, and
`unknown` describe that DNS comparison. They do not establish ownership or
affiliation.

The optional OTX key comes only from `WHODIS_OTX_API_KEY` and is never written
to Whodis configuration, reports, snapshots, or logs. Customize harmless
defaults with `whodis config set related-limit`, `research-links`,
`investigation-link`, and `otx-endpoint`. `investigation-link` remains an
optional custom HTTPS template containing `{type}` and `{value}`. Enrichment
opt-in itself is never persisted.

## Snapshots, change detection, and policy checks

Eligible local observations can be saved as snapshots. Dedicated API-token and
TSIG-secret fields, raw DNS packets, request IDs, and timings are removed before
storage. Local investigation reports can be saved; runs using third-party
enrichment cannot:

```bash
whodis inspect example.com --save --label production
whodis snapshot list
whodis snapshot show production
whodis diff production --live
```

For safety, a live replay does not activate custom registry servers or DNS
resolver endpoints stored in an imported snapshot. If you created and trust
the snapshot, opt in explicitly with `whodis diff production --live
--allow-snapshot-endpoints`.

Diffs are semantic and deterministic: record ordering and TTL churn are ignored
unless `--include-ttl` is requested. A provider failure makes its section
uncertain instead of manufacturing a removal. Exit status `5` means material
changes were found; `6` means the comparison was incomplete.

`whodis check` turns the same reports into CI- and monitoring-friendly policy
results:

```bash
whodis check example.com
whodis check example.com --active --scrutiny strict
whodis check example.com --against production --policy whodis-policy.yaml --json
whodis check --snapshot production
```

The built-in `basic`, `standard`, and `strict` scrutiny levels cover
registration expiry, nameservers, DNSSEC, diagnostic findings, and TLS expiry.
Strict YAML/JSON policies can require registration states, DNS records,
nameservers, MX values, DNSSEC state, certificate lifetime, or allowed diff
paths. Optional webhooks are sent only for failed or unknown checks; their URL
can be read from an environment variable or file to keep it out of shell
history. Start with examples/whodis-policy.yaml.
Snapshots never run in the background.

## Batch checks and files

Most registration and workstation commands accept several targets and preserve
input order while using bounded concurrency:

```bash
whodis expires google.com yahoo.com
whodis get expiration,registrar,status -i domains.txt -o results.txt
whodis diagnose example.com example.net --ndjson -o diagnosis.ndjson
printf 'google.com\nyahoo.com\n' | whodis expires
```

Use `--jobs 1` through `--jobs 32` to control concurrency. Individual failures
remain attributed to their input and do not erase successful results. Existing
files are protected unless `--force` is supplied. `.json`, `.ndjson`, `.csv`,
`.yaml`, `.md`, and `.txt` output names select their formats automatically.
Use `-f/--format` when an extension should not decide. `check` and `diff`
support plain text, JSON, YAML, and Markdown through the same file rules.

## Choose defaults once

Run the interactive wizard:

```bash
whodis config
```

Whodis interactive configuration wizard showing output format and color choices

It configures output layout, color, notice detail, DNS resolver and DNSSEC
defaults, the manual research-link preset and related-result limit, plus the
scrutiny and passive/active mode used by `whodis check`.
Press Enter to retain a choice or review everything before saving. Direct
commands are available for automation:

```bash
whodis config set format tree
whodis config set resolver 'https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query'
whodis config set strategy consensus
whodis config set dnssec on
whodis config set scrutiny strict
whodis config set check-mode passive
whodis config set related-limit 50
whodis config set investigation-link 'https://otx.alienvault.com/indicator/{type}/{value}'
whodis config get resolver
whodis config reset
```

Command-line options always override saved defaults; `--no-dnssec` provides an
explicit one-run override. Generate shell completion with `whodis completion
bash|zsh|fish|powershell`.

## Command shape

```text
whodis <target>
whodis registration <target...>
whodis inspect <domain...>
whodis dns query <name> [TYPE...]
whodis dns inventory <domain...>
whodis dns compare <name> [TYPE...]
whodis dns trace <name> [TYPE]
whodis dns transfer <zone>
whodis diagnose <domain...>
whodis investigate <domain...>
whodis check <target...>
whodis snapshot <list|show|remove|export|import|path> ...
whodis diff <snapshot> <snapshot>|--live
whodis expires <target...>
whodis get <fields> <target...>
```

Add `-f dashboard|tree|geekboys|plain|json|yaml|csv|ndjson|markdown|raw` to
select output (the equivalent long shortcuts also work). `whodis help dns`,
`whodis help diagnose`, `whodis help investigate`, and `whodis help advanced`
document operation-specific controls; `whodis help` also lists offline guides
for workflows and troubleshooting. The older `scan` and `axfr` spellings
remain available for compatibility.

## How registration routing works

Whodis caches IANA's RDAP bootstrap registries for domains, IPv4, IPv6, and
ASNs. Domain routes use the longest registry suffix; IP routes use the longest
network prefix; ASN routes use the published number ranges. HTTPS endpoints are
preferred and alternate endpoints are tried before changing protocol.

When no RDAP service is published, Whodis asks `whois.iana.org` for the
authoritative WHOIS server and follows a bounded referral chain. It follows a
published `rwhois://` referral automatically. A direct authority can be forced
with `whodis rdap|whois|rwhois ... --server`; RWhois direct mode requires the
server because no global RWhois bootstrap exists.

Automatic routing falls back only for an unavailable or unusable service.
Authoritative not-found and rate-limit responses remain visible. `--try-both`
widens diagnostic fallback and `--strict` disables it.

Automatically discovered RDAP URLs require HTTPS, and automatic RDAP,
WHOIS, and RWhois referrals to private, loopback, link-local, documentation, or
other special-use addresses are blocked. Diagnose and Investigate apply the
same rule to target-derived web, TLS, SMTP, MTA-STS, and advertised-service
destinations, including every HTTP redirect. Explicitly managed internal
infrastructure can opt in per run with `--allow-private`; automatic HTTP RDAP
requires the separate `--allow-insecure-http` exception.

## Go SDK and report schema

The supported public API is renderer-independent. The CLI and GUI both call the
same concurrency-safe `Engine` and provider boundaries:

```go
engine := whodis.NewEngine(whodis.EngineOptions{})
report, err := engine.Run(ctx, whodis.Request{
    Operation: whodis.OperationDNSQuery,
    Target:    "example.com",
    DNS:       whodis.DNSOptions{Types: []string{"A", "AAAA", "MX"}},
})
err = whodis.RenderReport(os.Stdout, report, whodis.FormatJSON, whodis.RenderOptions{})
```

`Report` schema version 5 keeps registration, DNS, diagnosis, investigation,
findings, and provider-scoped errors independent, so one failed registry,
probe, or enrichment does not erase useful results. Schema v5 adds explainable
stack components, a bounded homepage profile, network attribution, curated
manual research links, and bounded related observations. Snapshot replay
continues to read schema-v4 snapshots.
Diagnostic findings are aggregated once at report level instead of being
duplicated inside the diagnosis payload.
`Engine.RunBatch` preserves input order, while `Engine.RunStream` handles input
incrementally with bounded work and progress callbacks. Registration, DNS,
Diagnose, Investigation, and named Enrichment providers are interfaces for
embedding and deterministic tests. `EngineLimits` independently bounds batch
size, registration lookups, and nested diagnostic probes for long-lived or
multi-tenant integrations. Engine instances share the immutable compiled web
fingerprint catalog, so repeatedly constructing an embedded engine does not
rebuild that large dataset.

The native GUI's private newline-delimited JSON-RPC protocol is version 5 and
carries schema-v5 reports through the same operation engine as the CLI, plus
progress, cancellation, the research-provider catalog, short-lived in-memory
result tokens, and exports. See
v2 migration guide when upgrading an embedded v1
client.

## Development and release integrity

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alex9001/whodis.git
cd whodis
go -C v2 test -race ./...
go -C v2 vet ./...
scripts/check-complexity.sh go
go -C v2 test ./... -run '^$' -bench . -benchtime=100ms
go -C v2 run ./cmd/whodis example.com
```

The Go module uses the standard `v2/` major-version directory. Its public
module path remains `github.com/Alex9001/whodis/v2`.

The desktop build additionally needs CMake, Ninja, Qt 6 Core/Gui/Widgets/Test,
and a C++17 compiler; source builds require Go 1.25 or newer. With Clang and
Clang-Tidy installed, `scripts/check-complexity.sh all` also enforces the Go
and C++ complexity regression guardrails used by CI. See
desktop/README.md. Tests use
fixtures and in-memory protocol sessions rather than consuming public registry
or Globalping quota. Parser, importer, and renderer fuzz targets run on a
monthly maintenance workflow; its public-protocol compatibility job is manual
and advisory so ordinary CI stays deterministic and offline.

Release automation has a non-publishing preflight that cross-builds the pure-Go
CLI and every native desktop bundle before a tag is created. It runs race and
vulnerability checks, generates staged-content SBOMs and SHA-256 checksums,
bundles the SBOMs into one auditor-friendly download, attests the exact release
bytes, and only then publishes them. Releases remain split into CLI and GUI
assets so a server never needs to install Qt.

## Boundaries and honest limitations

- RWhois has no global bootstrap registry. Automatic discovery needs a
 published RDAP `port43` hint or WHOIS `ReferralServer`; otherwise use an
 explicit `rwhois --server` authority.
- DNS inventory checks a maintained set of practical owner names and record
 types; DNS has no universal record-list operation. Only a successful AXFR is
 a complete zone, and most public authoritative servers correctly refuse it.
- Local DNSSEC validation currently validates positive signed answer chains.
 Authenticated denial proofs for NXDOMAIN/NODATA are reported as
 `indeterminate` rather than overstated as secure.
- Path tracing can require operating-system ICMP permissions. Whodis reports a
 scoped warning when the host does not allow the native probe.
- Diagnose samples bounded representative addresses, MX hosts, and advertised
 services. It is evidence collection, not continuous monitoring or an
 exhaustive security audit.
- Technology fingerprints and provider mappings are evidence-backed best
 efforts, not contractual proof. Sites can hide, proxy, or spoof headers and
 infrastructure. The homepage audit is a static, single-response observation:
 it does not execute JavaScript, fetch assets, crawl pages, measure browser
 performance, claim that an unobserved plugin is absent, grade a site, or
 perform a vulnerability assessment. Passive-DNS neighbors are historical
 observations, not ownership, customer, or compromise claims.
- Raw source output is limited to one registration response. Multi-target and
 workstation operations use human-readable or structured report formats.
- The desktop batch workspace accepts up to 1,000 targets and retains recent
 exportable results in a bounded in-memory cache. Use CLI NDJSON streaming for
 larger jobs.
- Saved snapshots are local files, not a scheduler or hosted monitoring
 service. Use cron, systemd timers, Task Scheduler, or CI to run checks.
- Authenticated registry accounts, proprietary registry APIs, web scraping,
 generic port scanning, telemetry, mobile apps, and app-store distribution are
 intentionally out of scope.
- Desktop packages are currently unsigned and distributed through GitHub
 Releases; SmartScreen and Gatekeeper may require a deliberate first launch.
