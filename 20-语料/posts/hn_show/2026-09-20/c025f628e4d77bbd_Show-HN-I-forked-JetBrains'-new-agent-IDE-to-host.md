## README

# ThinkRail — CommanderTvis fork

A fork of JetBrains/thinkrail. Upstream is a desktop-and-mobile
client for the `pi` coding agent. This
fork turns it into a workbench for more than one agent: Claude Code runs in its terminals as a first-class
agent, with its own configuration pane, IDE bridge, hooks, launcher and the workspace's spec tools reachable
over MCP.

An early-work Codex plugin adds another terminal agent integration, and a plugin API lets
further integrations live outside core. The fork also carries a stream of fixes and features that are
sent upstream one commit at a time.

ThinkRail workbench with Claude Code running in the terminal

The workbench combines project and worktree navigation on the left, an embedded Claude Code terminal session in the center, and the workspace file tree alongside the Claude Code side panel on the right.

## What the fork has that upstream does not

**A plugin API.** `packages/plugin-api` is the contract: a manifest, typed methods, channels and settings, a
pi-free tool definition for the agent and MCP surfaces, and host and web contexts. The server loads builtin
and external plugins, validates their wire traffic, serves their assets and feeds their pi resources into
every session; the web client loads a plugin's UI half, at build time for builtins or over the wire for an
external one. `packages/plugin-ui` is the shared UI kit plugins draw with. External plugins live under
`~/.thinkrail/plugins/ /` or at the paths `AppConfig.pluginPaths` lists. See `packages/plugin-api/SPEC.md` and
`packages/server/src/plugins/SPEC.md`.

Plugins settings dialog

The plugin settings panel lists registered plugins, their origin (builtin or external), and their declared contributions: side tools, file viewers, and system prompt modifiers. Plugins can be toggled on or off individually.

**Nine builtin plugins**, each one commit, each extractable to its own repository. Claude Code and Codex
integrate terminal agents; the others add specification tools, viewers or presence:

| Plugin | What it adds |
| --- | --- |
| `plugin-spec-dialect` | the spec-graph read, the Specs side tool and the `spec_*` tool renderers |
| `plugin-blueprint` | the Blueprint interactive-spec format, its author and reactor |
| `plugin-claude-code` | Claude Code as the terminal agent: config pane, IDE bridge, hook status, launcher, terminal facts and picker driving, the shipped Claude marketplace |
| `plugin-codex` | Early work: OpenAI Codex as a terminal agent, with a config pane, launcher, hook status and ThinkRail MCP tools |
| `plugin-discord` | Discord Rich Presence over local IPC |
| `plugin-pdf-preview` | a PDF file viewer |
| `plugin-branch-graph` | the project's Git Graph side tool |
| `plugin-visualize` | the terminal agent's live drawing surface, surfaced as an MCP tool |
| `plugin-file-icons` | material-icon-theme file-type glyphs |

### Claude Code

The Claude Code plugin bridges terminal agent sessions to ThinkRail's workspace and UI. An IDE bridge feeds terminal events and facts into the app, drives terminal pickers from native UI controls, and manages context and capabilities:

Claude Code model picker in the terminal status bar

Terminal facts and picker driving: selecting a model or effort level from the terminal bar drives Claude Code's interactive `/model` picker behind the scenes. The adjacent Attach File button inserts workspace-relative `@file` paths directly into the prompt.

Claude Code persistent context tab

The Context tab displays active instructions across global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, project `CLAUDE.md`, and referenced `AGENTS.md` files with live size accounting, making context weight immediately visible.

Claude Code capabilities tab and MCP bridge

The Capabilities tab lists what Claude Code can reach: installed plugins, skills, hooks, and ThinkRail's loopback MCP server (`plugin:thinkrail:thinkrail`). The local MCP bridge exposes the workspace's spec tools directly to Claude Code.

Claude Code capability scope actions

Scope management for plugins, skills, and MCP servers: switch, move, or promote any capability between User (global), Project (checked in for all collaborators), and Local (private to this repo) directly from the action menu.

### Codex (early work)

The builtin Codex plugin is an early integration of the Codex CLI into the workbench. It launches Codex
in a terminal, offers session resume and fork actions, reports hook-driven status, and connects launched
sessions to ThinkRail's MCP tools. Its side pane shows instruction files, layered settings, hooks and MCP
servers, plus account and usage information.

The integration is still developing. Configuration discovery currently covers the user, system and
worktree-root files; profiles and nested project configuration are not modelled. See
`packages/plugin-codex/SPEC.md` for the current scope and limitations.

### Blueprint interactive specifications

The Blueprint plugin pairs agent authoring with an interactive spec viewer, for both terminal agents and regular `pi` chats:

Blueprint interactive spec editor with Claude Code authoring BLUEPRINT.md

Claude Code or a `pi` chat writes and edits `BLUEPRINT.md`, verifying changes using ThinkRail's `blueprint_check` MCP tool. Side-by-side, the Blueprint viewer renders interactive decision cards, option selectors, and rationale blocks live.

### Improvements that apply to upstream directly

Kept as atomic commits so each can become a pull request: open a plain folder as a project without git,
clone a repository URL into a project, search the whole workspace from one popup, drag and trash files in
the tree, send an editor selection into a pi chat, the spec tools reachable by any terminal agent over MCP,
an outline column that drives preview and source, frontmatter as an Obsidian-style properties block, a
code font of your choice with ligatures, Cmd+F in every preview, a terminal that thaws after a lost drain
event, a pty that no longer inherits a stale utmpx user, and TypeScript 7.

## Install

Nightly builds of the fork ship through the
`CommanderTvis/homebrew-thinkrail` tap:

```bash
brew trust --tap commandertvis/thinkrail   # Homebrew 7+ refuses untrusted taps
brew tap commandertvis/thinkrail
brew install --cask thinkrail-desktop   # the Electrobun desktop app (ThinkRail-canary.app)
brew install thinkrail                  # or: the CLI host, `thinkrail` opens the browser client
```

The builds are unsigned and not notarized; the cask strips the quarantine flag after install so Gatekeeper
does not report the app as damaged. To run from source instead, see below.

## Clone and run

The fork is developed and tested on macOS only. Other platforms build, but nothing here has been run on
them.

Prerequisites: Bun 1.4, Node.js 22.19 or newer, `git` on PATH, and an authenticated `pi` provider. App
state lives under `~/.thinkrail`.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CommanderTvis/thinkrail.git
cd thinkrail
bun install
bun run desktop:dev
```

`bun run desktop:dev` packages the Electrobun desktop app with the host inside it and opens it. This is the
normal way to use the fork. Alternative:

```bash
bun run dev # host + web client in the browser, with hot reload
```

## Updating

A Homebrew install updates with `brew upgrade thinkrail` / `brew upgrade --cask thinkrail-desktop`.

A checkout: the branch is force-pushed very often. A plain `git pull` will not fast-forward. Update by
taking the remote branch as it is:

```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/claude-code-integration-plugin-api
bun install
bun run desktop:dev
```

## Analytics & Privacy

Unchanged from upstream: basic usage events (launches, chat creation, accepted message sends, provider
connections) are always on; additional setup, run-outcome, task, review, and PR statistics require explicit
consent in the first-launch window and change later in **Settings → Privacy**. `thinkrail --no-analytics` or
`THINKRAIL_NO_ANALYTICS=1` suppresses additional events for that run only. Upstream's README describes details.
