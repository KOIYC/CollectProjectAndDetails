# The Creator Browser Wakes “Browser Mode” for your desktop application app.exe.

# How It Works: Enabling Browser Mode

## Installation & Setup

1. After installing [**Creator**](https://github.com/AIGCEra/Creator/releases/tag/FirstRelease), you receive a lightweight 20.1KB application launcher named `Loader.exe`(C:\Program Files\Tangram\Creator\Loader.exe).
2. If your desktop application is named `app.exe`, copy `Loader.exe` into the same directory.
3. Rename `Loader.exe` to `appLoader.exe`.

## Launch Modes

- **Normal Mode**: Launch your original `app.exe` as usual.
- **Browser Mode**: Launch `appLoader.exe` to enable enhanced capabilities.

## Behind the Scenes

When launched in God Mode:

- `appLoader.exe` starts `app.exe` as the **Browser Process** of the Creator Browser.
- `appLoadery.exe` exits immediately and plays no further role.

## What Happens in Browser Mode?

Your application transforms into an **application content ecosystem interpreter** capable of:

- Translating **web pages**, **XML**, or **LLM-generated content descriptions** into dynamic interfaces.
- Treating native windows (including Chromium browser windows, WinForms, MFC `CView`, and others) as **tokens**.
- Dynamically composing user interfaces in a manner similar to building webpages.

## Key Advantage

- ✅ No modifications to original code are required.
- ✅ No recompilation is necessary.
- ✅ Your app instantly becomes a **super composite UI generator**.

# Project Vision: Super Web Content Ecosystem for Native Desktop Applications

## 🎯 Objective

To extend existing and in-development 64-bit desktop applications (especially those built with **.NET, C++/MFC, and Win32 SDK**) into a **Super Web Content Ecosystem** that surpasses conventional web browsers. This system seamlessly integrates native desktop window objects into a Web DOM-like environment, treating them as extensible elements analogous to HTML ` ` tags.

## ✨ Core Features

### 1. **Super Web Browser Capabilities**

- Enable developers to view standard desktop applications as **advanced web browsers** capable of rendering and interpreting custom web content.
 - Allows writing and integrating webpages directly into native applications without modifying their original source code.

### 2. **Dynamic Description-Driven UI Mechanism**

- Introduces a **Web DOM-based dynamic description mechanism** to control the structure and layout of native desktop window objects.
 - Developers can assemble complex **Composite Native Window Objects** in a intuitive, HTML-like manner—similar to organizing `div` elements to build rich web content.

### 3. **Native Support for LLM Integration**

- By representing desktop applications as Super Web Browsers, **Large Language Model (LLM)** technologies can be deeply and natively integrated.
 - Enables AI-enhanced content generation and interaction within **any desktop application—even without source code access**.

## 🔧 Supported Technologies

- .NET (Windows Forms, WPF)
- C++/MFC
- Win32 SDK
- 64-bit applications

## 🌟 Benefits

- Unifies native performance with web-style dynamic content.
- Protects existing software investments while enabling modern web and AI features.
- Allows seamless blending of native windows and web content within a unified scripting and layout environment.

# Background and Vision

## Current Landscape

Developers have built — and continue to build — countless 64-bit desktop applications using well-established technologies such as **.NET**, **C++/MFC**, and the **Win32 SDK**. However, once these applications are compiled, their user interfaces become largely static and difficult to modify at runtime. The structure of native windows — whether built with MFC, Windows Forms, or the Win32 API — remains fixed, limiting developers' ability to dynamically adjust or extend the UI after deployment.

For example, consider a typical compiled desktop application:

## The Vision: Dynamic & AI-Enhanced Desktop Experiences

What if we could transcend these limitations? Imagine enabling such applications to:

- Embed a **tabbed web browser group** directly into their main window:

- Use **AI and large language models** (e.g., ChatGPT) to dynamically reconfigure their layout and functionality during runtime:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5413e8e7-f307-4cce-814e-18e3d72c33d1)

This vision aims to transform static desktop applications into flexible, composable environments that support web-style dynamism and AI-powered customization — all without requiring source code access or recompilation.

After installing Creator, you get a tiny 6.5KB(EV Signed Size:20.1KB) application launcher Loader.exe.
If your desktop app is app.exe, simply copy Loader.exe into the same folder as app.exe and rename it apLoader.exe.

Launch app.exe for normal mode; launch appLoader.exe to enter God Mode.
proxy.exe launches app.exe as the Creator Browser’s Browser Process, then exits immediately, playing no further role.
In God Mode, your application becomes an application content ecosystem interpreter:
It can transform web pages, XML, or LLM content descriptions into dynamic interfaces.
Native windows (such as Chromium browser windows, WinForm, MFC CView, etc.) are treated as tokens, dynamically composing the UI like a webpage.

No changes to the original code or recompilation are needed—your app instantly becomes a super composite UI generator.
